			<i>This guide will use this data:<a class="link_to" href="">The Veil Nebulae</a></i>
			<p> 
                In this guide we will process the nebulae.

                Each instrument will be separated. And each will be marked by difficulty: <br>
                ðŸŸ©(Easy)- does not depend on the type of DSO, taste or other factors. Can be repeated identically. <br>
                ðŸŸ§(Moderate)- partly depends on the object, your sense of taste also affects at it, it 
                is advisable to select the parameters yourself. <br>
                ðŸŸ¥(Hard)- highly depends on the image quality, DSO type, your taste, the availability of 
                external lighting, the quality of your screen and many additional factors. It is not
                recommended to completely repeat the process in these tools; you need to select the parameters yourself.
            </p>

            <p> <font color="red">
                Please note that this guide shows the possibilities of using various tools,
                but this does not mean that you should completely copy my processing method. 
                Experiment, swap tools, repeat BGE or color saturation several times - complete
                freedom of action. So you will most likely be able to process it better than me ^_^

                First we need to at least see something. Let's enable Autostretch:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/"><br>
                Quite often you will notice that the entire image is very green or red. 
                In order to see something, you need unchain channels.<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/"><br>
                Now we need a crop in order to remove stacking artifacts 
                (they are close to the image borders), and also to make the galaxy better visible.
                Hold down the left mouse button, draw a rectangle, center it on the galaxy and press the right button. <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/"><br>
            </p>
