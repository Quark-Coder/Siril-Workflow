			<p> 
                Nebula is quite challenging to process as 
				it usually takes up a lot of space, making it 
				difficult to align the background and get an 
				overall idea of â€‹â€‹the object's brightness. However, Eastern Veil Nebula
				is a simple object - its contrast makes it easy to 
				get color and detail.

                Each instrument will be separated. And each will be marked by difficulty: <br>
                ðŸŸ©(Easy)- does not depend on the type of DSO, taste or other factors. Can be repeated identically. <br>
                ðŸŸ§(Moderate)- partly depends on the object, your sense of taste also affects at it, it 
                is advisable to select the parameters yourself. <br>
                ðŸŸ¥(Hard)- highly depends on the image quality, DSO type, your taste, the availability of 
                external lighting, the quality of your screen and many additional factors. It is not
                recommended to completely repeat the process in these tools; you need to select the parameters yourself.
            </p>

                Please note that this guide shows the possibilities of using various tools,
                but this does not mean that you should completely copy my processing method. 
                Experiment, swap tools, repeat BGE or color saturation several times - complete
                freedom of action. So you will most likely be able to process it better than me ^_^

                Let's enable Autostretch:<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/autostretch.jpg"><br>
                Quite often you will notice that the entire image is very green or red. 
                In order to see something, you need unchain channels.<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/unchain.jpg"><br>
                Now we need a crop in order to remove stacking artifacts 
                (they are close to the image borders), and also to make the galaxy better visible.
                Hold down the left mouse button, draw a rectangle, center it on the galaxy and press the right button. <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/crop.jpg" width="1110px"><br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ§(Moderate)-ðŸŸ¥(Hard) Color calibration </h2>
            <p> 
                Color calibration allows you to adjust the color of the entire image.
                This will also correct any green or red color you may have seen in the beginning. <br> 
                Let's use PCC (Photometric Color Calibration): <br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/color_calibr_1.jpg">
                <img src="../img/galaxy/color_calibr_2.jpg" style="vertical-align: top;"> <br>
                Find your object (if you don't know what it's called, use 
                <a class="link_to" href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> or 
                <a class="link_to" href="https://nova.astrometry.net/upload" target="_blank">Astrometry</a>).
                Enter the focal length and pixel size (for this object 1284.7mm and 4.63Î¼m).<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/PCC.jpg"> <br>
                Wait for the PCC to complete its work:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/PCC_console.jpg"> <br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ©(Easy) StarNet++ </h2>
            <p> 
                Now let`s run Starnet: <br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/star_procc_1.jpg"> 
                <img src="../img/galaxy/star_procc_2.jpg" style="vertical-align: top;"> <br>
                Check the linear image pre-stretch checkbox: <br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/star_procc_3.jpg"> <br>
                <font color="red">It will take some time...</font> <br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/star_procc_4.jpg"> <br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ¥(Hard) GHT (Generalized Hyperbolic Transformations) AKA Stretch </h2>
            <p> 
                Stretching is the second most important task in all processing.
                This is where you get all the detail that makes astrophotography so interesting.
                First we need to do a preliminary stretch to see the object:<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/ght_1.jpg"> <br>
                Select the logarithmic scale check box and move local stretch intensity slider to the max (15.0):<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/GHT_1.jpg"> <br>
                Now, by changing the Stretch factor you need to shift the peak of the histogram two squares to the right: <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/GHT_2.jpg" width="1100px"> <br>

				<a name="black_points">Now let`s make background darker. Click on the area where the histogram peak is located.</a>
                Afterwards, move the Highlight protection slider so that it is identical to the
                Symmetry point slider. Also set local stretch intensity to max:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/GHT_3.jpg"><br>
                Now, changing the linear stretch, shift the histogram to the left until there is a small gap left:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/GHT_4.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
                Now let's repeat the Stretch.
                <img src="../img/nebulae/GHT_5.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ©(Easy) BGE (BackGround Extraction) </h2>
            <p> 
                This tool allows you to align and make the background more uniform:<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/BGE.jpg"> <br>
                Click Generate to create a grid of samples:<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/BGE_2.jpg"> <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/BGE_1.jpg"> <br>
                Now, by clicking the left mouse button to create a 
                sample and the right mouse button to delete it, we need to edit the grid
                so that the samples only go to the background and not to the object:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/BGE_2.jpg"> <br>
                When you have edited the grid, click Compute background and Apply:<br>
                <img src="../img/galaxy/BGE_5.jpg"> <br>
                Now the background looks smooth: <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/BGE_3.jpg"><br>
            </p>

			<h3>GHT</h3>
            <p>
				Now let`s again do several stretch and background darkenings. At stretch you must get as much detail as possible, 
                but you must not overexpose the nebulae, especially the brightest parts. If you see that the nebulae parts 
                are too bright, move the local stretch intensity slider to the right until it becomes less bright:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/Next_GHT_1.jpg"><br>
                <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/Next_GHT_2.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
                <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/Next_GHT_3.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
                <br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/Next_GHT_4.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ§(Moderate) CLAHE(Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation) </h2>
            <p>   
                This tool allows you to get even more detail: <br> 
                <img src="../img/galaxy/contrast_limited_1.jpg" ><br>
                If you overdo it, the background will become noisy too.
                Adjust the tiles grid size until you get more detail without
                artifacts or looking too unnatural:<br>
                <img src="../img/nebulae/CLAHE.jpg" width="1100px"><br>
            </p>

			<h2> ðŸŸ©(Easy) Noise reduction </h2>
            <p>     
                Depending on the image quality, the amount of noise may vary. 
                However, using a noise removal program, it is possible to obtain
                more detail than without it. To do this, save the image as starless.tif
                32 bit (.TIFF format). Then open the program, drag-and-drop the image, in
                the settings on the right side, select Several noise and on Model Preference.
                Press save.<br>
